# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  Projects

Welcome to my Projects! 🚀 This repository contains **EDA projects** on different datasets and **one data cleaning & processing script**. Each project focuses on uncovering insights through visualizations and data preprocessing techniques.

## 📂 Project Overview

### 1️⃣ **Titanic Dataset - EDA** 🛳️
**Dataset:** Passenger survival data from the Titanic disaster.

**Key Analysis:**
- Understanding survival rates based on **age, gender, and class**.
- Detecting and handling **missing values** in columns.
- Visualizing survival trends using **Seaborn and Matplotlib**.



---

### 2️⃣ **House Prices Dataset - EDA** 🏡
**Dataset:** Housing market data containing property features and sale prices.

**Key Analysis:**
- Correlation analysis between **features and house prices**.
- Feature engineering: **Handling missing values and outliers**.
- Price distribution analysis using **histograms and boxplots**.



---

### 3️⃣ **IPL Dataset - EDA** 🏏
**Dataset:** Indian Premier League cricket statistics.

**Key Analysis:**
- **Player performance trends** (runs, wickets, strike rates over years).
- Visualizing team-wise performance using **bar charts & heatmaps**.
- Predicting performance trends using **correlation analysis**.



---

- ### 4 **Bank Transactions Dataset - EDA** 
**Dataset:** Transaction statistics of people.

**Key Analysis:**
- **Transactions trends** (amount, date, mode use for transaction,age).
- Visualizing transactions frequency, total amount in a month through **line plot & hist plot**.
- Then fiding which age is group are doing more transaction, then transaction ration between debit card and credit card with help of **pie chart, bar chart** and many more.
- **Predictions**: Based on transaction trends, we can predict peak transaction periods (March and September), high transaction frequency among youth (ages 20–30), and potential increases in sales and service demand during these times, especially from student demographics.

5️⃣ **Rape Cases in India - EDA** 📊
**Dataset:** Crime data related to rape cases reported across India.

**Key Analysis:**
- State-wise and year-wise distribution of rape cases.
- Trend analysis to uncover temporal patterns and spikes.
- Demographic insights based on victim age and location.
- Visualizations through bar charts, heatmaps, and line graphs.

## 🛠️ Data Cleaning & Processing
### **Practice Script: Cleaning & Processing Data** 🧹
This script demonstrates **data preprocessing techniques** on raw datasets.

**Includes:**
✅ Handling missing values (drop/impute)  
✅ Removing duplicates  
✅ Converting data types  
✅ Feature scaling & encoding categorical data
